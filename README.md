## Axiomatic Primitives & Derived Ontology

> *"Curvature does not resist — it remembers."*

This repository contains the complete axiomatic foundation of **Business Field Theory** — the mathematical substrate underlying Auto-Workspace-AI and Intent Tensor Theory applications.

## What This Is

**Executable Physics** is the formal derivation of commercial mechanics from first principles. Unlike traditional business frameworks that start with intuitions about markets, agents, and transactions, this work builds upward from four axiomatic primitives:

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Φ** | Scalar Potential | Possibility of recursive distinction |
| **∇Φ** | Ordering Gradient | Preference asymmetry (not motion) |
| **σ** | Irreducible Residue | Memory of misalignment |
| **ρ_q** | Boundary Charge | Value frozen at termination surfaces |

Everything else — identity, time, resources, exchange, markets, firms, personnel — is **derived**, not assumed.

## Key Results

### Time Is Derived, Not Assumed
```
τ(k) := σ_k
```
Time is the monotonic ordering of accumulated irreversibility.

### Value Is Frozen Misalignment
```
ρ_q := σ(τ_Δ)
```
Value exists only at boundaries where recursion terminates.

### Firms Are Markets Turned Inward
A firm is a σ-suppression structure that replaces price-mediated exchange with internal lock-mediated coordination.

### Burnout Is σ Overflow
```
Role-Human match requires: σ_absorption ≥ σ_production
```
