# Executable Physics

**The 11-Book Mathematical Framework for Intent Tensor Theory**

Derives commercial mechanics from four axiomatic primitives as computable physics.

## The Four Primitives (Book 0A)

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| Φ | Scalar Potential | The field itself. Values are collapsed states. |
| ∇Φ | Ordering Gradient | Direction of collapse flow. Preference asymmetry. |
| σ | Irreducible Residue | What cannot be undone. Accumulated irreversibility. |
| ρ_q | Boundary Charge | Where collapse terminates. Frozen value at limits. |

**Rule**: Everything else is DERIVED, not assumed.

## The Collapse Dynamics Equation

$$\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 \Phi - \lambda (\Phi - \Phi_{\text{lock}}) + \eta \cdot \dot{\sigma}$$

## The Six Fans (Δ₁-Δ₆)

| Fan | Operator | Physical Meaning |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| Δ₁ | ∇Φ | Tension alignment, translation |
| Δ₂ | ∇×(∇Φ) | Curl phase memory, rotation |
| Δ₃ | +∇²Φ | Expansion, diffusion, tiling |
| Δ₄ | -∇²Φ | Compression, locking, cropping |
| Δ₅ | ∂Φ/∂t | Emergence, iteration control |
| Δ₆ | Φ₀ | Identity, background anchor |

## New Documentation

### docs/ITT_DERIVATION_GAPS.md
Identifies concepts that were "smuggled" (imported without derivation) and provides rigorous derivations from the four primitives.

### docs/BOOK_0A_SUPPLEMENT.md
Full theorem-proof structure for all derived concepts:
- Objects as Laplacian-sign regions
- Enclosure via winding numbers
- Shape as eigenspectrum
- Size→Color from energy minimization
- Period via Fourier analysis
