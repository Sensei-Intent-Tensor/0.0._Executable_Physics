# BOOK 2: STATICS

## Persistence, Equilibrium, and Viability Without Motion

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Prerequisite**: Book 0A, 0B, 1, N

---

## Book 2 Mandate

Book 2 must answer one question only:

**What configurations can exist stably if nothing "moves"?**

If we smuggle dynamics here, the whole structure collapses.

We proceed with one allowance only: **Configurations may be compared across repetitions.**

---

## Section 2.1: Repetition Without Time

We introduce a minimal construct:

**A repetition index k ∈ ℕ**

This is **not time**. It does not imply duration, rate, or causality.

It means only: "This configuration is evaluated again under the same constraints."

---

## Section 2.2: Static Configuration Definition

A **configuration** is defined as the tuple:

```
Ω_k = (Φ, σ_k, ℒ, ρ_q)
```

Where:
- Φ is fixed (potential does not change in statics)
- ℒ is fixed (capacity is structural)
- σ may accumulate
- ρ_q exists only if a boundary has already formed

---

## Section 2.3: Static Viability Condition

From Book 1, we already have the condition:

```
σ_k ≤ ℒ
```

This is the **static viability inequality**.

If this holds across repetitions:
- the configuration is **stable**
- identity persists
- no Δ occurs

If violated:
- the configuration is **ineligible**
- Δ must occur

---

## Section 2.4: Static Equilibrium

A configuration is in static equilibrium if repeated evaluation does not change its viability status.

Formally:
```
σ_{k+1} = σ_k  and  σ_k < ℒ
```

This implies:
- no new misalignment residue is produced
- ordering is respected
- no boundary forms

**Equilibrium = zero additional σ per repetition.**

---

## Section 2.5: Static Strain

A configuration is **strained** if σ increases across repetitions but remains below ℒ.

Formally:
```
σ_{k+1} > σ_k  and  σ_k < ℒ
```

Interpretation:
- misalignment exists
- memory grows
- persistence is still possible

This is the *only* precursor to transition.

---

## Section 2.6: Static Failure (Pre-Delta)

**Static Failure Condition:**
```
σ_k ≥ ℒ
```

This does not yet cause reconfiguration. It only states:

"This configuration is no longer statically viable."

Reconfiguration is *permitted*, not executed.

---

## Section 2.7: Boundary Formation in Statics

Recall from Book 0A: ρ_q emerges only where recursion terminates.

In statics, termination means:

**No further repetition of the same configuration is permitted.**

Thus:
```
ρ_q = σ_k  at  σ_k = ℒ
```

This is **static value**. No exchange. No market. No output.

Just **condensed residue at a termination surface**.

---

## Section 2.8: Classification of Static Configurations

| Class | Condition | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Null | Φ = 0 | No structure |
| Stable | σ = 0 | Perfect coherence |
| Equilibrium | 0 < σ < ℒ and constant | Persistent |
| Strained | σ increasing, σ < ℒ | Approaching Δ |
| Critical | σ = ℒ | Delta boundary |
| Terminated | σ condensed → ρ_q | Static completion |

This table is exhaustive. No other static states exist.

---

## Section 2.9: What Statics Gives Us

From statics alone, we now have:

✅ persistence  
✅ equilibrium  
✅ strain  
✅ failure  
✅ termination  
✅ value (as boundary residue)

Still missing:
- sequence ordering with consequence
- rates
- propagation
- interaction
- agents

Those require **dynamics** — Book 3.

## Book 2 Status

| Concept | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Repetition (not time) | ✅ |
| Equilibrium | ✅ |
| Strain | ✅ |
| Failure | ✅ |
| Static value | ✅ |

Still: ❌ No motion ❌ No trajectories ❌ No agents ❌ No business

*"What configurations can exist if nothing moves? This is statics."*
