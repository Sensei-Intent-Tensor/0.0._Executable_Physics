# BOOK 3: DYNAMICS

## Ordering, Transition, and the Birth of Time from Collapse

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Prerequisite**: Book 0A, 0B, 1, N, 2

---

## Book 3 Mandate

Book 3 must answer one question only:

**What distinguishes "before" from "after" if repetition can no longer be symmetric?**

We are not allowed to assume:
- external time
- rates
- continuous motion
- agents acting

We use only what already exists: Φ, ∇Φ, σ, ρ_q, ℒ, Δ (permission), and repetition index k.

---

## Section 3.1: Why Statics Is Insufficient

In Book 2, repetition was reversible:
- A configuration could be re-evaluated
- No ordering was enforced
- No "earlier" or "later" existed

But the moment **σ accumulates**, reversibility is broken.

**Accumulation creates asymmetry.**

This asymmetry is the seed of time.

---

## Section 3.2: Definition of Dynamic Ordering

**Dynamic Ordering:**

Configuration Ω_{k+1} is *after* Ω_k if and only if:

```
σ_{k+1} ≥ σ_k
```

- Equality → static
- Increase → dynamic progression

This ordering:
- does not require duration
- does not require speed
- cannot be reversed without violating Axiom 0A.3

**Time = monotonic σ-ordering.**

---

## Section 3.3: Emergent Time Parameter

We may now *define* time, but only implicitly.

**Emergent Time τ:**
```
τ(k) := σ_k
```

Time is not fundamental. It is **the label of accumulated irreversibility**.

- Two configurations with equal σ are simultaneous
- Configurations with higher σ are later
- There is no global clock — only local ordering

---

## Section 3.4: Dynamic State

We upgrade the configuration to a **dynamic state**:

```
Ω(τ) = (Φ, ∇Φ, σ(τ), ℒ, ρ_q)
```

Only σ is allowed to change with τ. Everything else is constrained by statics unless a Δ occurs.

---

## Section 3.5: Law of Dynamic Persistence

**Persistence Condition:**
```
dσ/dτ = 0
```

This is dynamic equilibrium.
- No new misalignment
- No time progression
- No evolution

**If nothing accumulates, time does not pass.**

---

## Section 3.6: Dynamic Strain and Pressure

**Collapse Pressure Π:**
```
Π := dσ/dτ
```

Interpretation:
- Π = 0 → static
- Π > 0 → strain
- Π → ∞ → imminent Δ

Pressure is not motion. It is **rate of irreversibility accumulation**.

---

## Section 3.7: Delta as a Dynamic Permission Operator

**Delta Condition (Dynamic):**
```
σ(τ) ≥ ℒ  ⟹  Δ permitted
```

Important:
- Δ is not caused
- Δ is not forced
- Δ is **enabled**

**Δ is a logical permission, not a push.**

---

## Section 3.8: The Delta Transition

When Δ occurs, the system **reconfigures**:

```
Ω⁻ →[Δ]→ Ω⁺
```

With rules:
- σ is partially condensed into ρ_q
- excess σ is released or redistributed
- ℒ may reset or transform
- Φ remains upstream (never consumed)

Formally:
```
ρ_q := σ(τ_Δ)
σ(τ_Δ⁺) = σ_residual  with  σ_residual < ℒ
```

This is the **collapse-and-rebuild** event.

---

## Section 3.9: Arrow of Time

**Theorem (Arrow of Time):**

Time has a direction because σ accumulation is irreversible.

- No entropy → no time
- No misalignment → no ordering

**The arrow of time is the arrow of remembered misalignment.**

---

## Section 3.10: Conservation Across Delta

From Book 0A.4: σ does not disappear — it condenses.

Thus:
```
σ_before = ρ_q + σ_after
```

This is the **first conservation law**.
- Not energy
- Not matter
- **Irreversibility**

---

## Section 3.11: Identity Emerges (No Agents Yet)

**Dynamic Identity:**

Identity is a region of persistent σ-carrying configuration across τ-ordering.

- No self
- No agent
- No decision

Just:
- persistence
- memory
- boundary
- consequence

**Identity = what survives Δ.**

---

## Section 3.12: What Dynamics Gives Us

From Book 3 alone, we now have:

✅ Time (emergent, local)  
✅ Ordering  
✅ Pressure  
✅ Transition  
✅ Conservation  
✅ Identity (non-agentic)

Still forbidden:
❌ Interaction  
❌ Exchange  
❌ Strategy  
❌ Business  
❌ Personnel

Those require **multiple identities** — Book 4.

*"Time emerges from remembered misalignment. Nothing more."*
