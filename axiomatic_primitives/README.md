## Overview

This repository contains the **complete axiomatic foundation** for Business Field Theory (BFT), derived from Intent Tensor Theory (ITT). 

The framework is stratified into precise layers:

```
BOOK 0A — Collapse Axioms (Pre-Geometric, ITT-level)
    │   • Φ exists (scalar potential)
    │   • Asymmetry permission (variation)
    │   • Entropy principle (irreversible residue)
    │   • Boundary emergence (value condensation)
    ▼
BOOK 0B — Geometric Crystallization (Derived Ontology)
    │   • Configuration set 𝒞
    │   • Ordering relation via δΦ
    │   • Identity (σ-carrying persistence)
    │   • Alignment 𝒜, Memory M, Lock ℒ
    │   • Transition boundary Δ
    ▼
BOOK 1 — Primitives (Mathematical Objects)
    │   • Units for Φ, σ, ρ_q, ℒ
    │   • Allowed operations
    │   • Measurement protocols
    ▼
BOOK 2+ — Dynamics & Applications
        • Personnel Tensor Theory
        • Bridge Tensor Theory
        • Auto-Workspace-AI Engineering
```

## The Four Axioms (Book 0A)

These are the **unprovable starting points** from which all of Business Field Theory derives.

| Axiom | Statement | What It Permits |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0A.1 | Φ exists as scalar potential | Recursive distinction possible |
| 0A.2 | Φ may vary internally | Collapse has preference ordering |
| 0A.3 | Departure from ordering produces σ | Irreversibility exists |
| 0A.4 | σ resolves only at boundaries → ρ_q | Value emerges at edges |

## Quick Reference: The Master Equations

### The Persistence Law

```
An identity I persists at depth n iff: σ(n) < ℒ(n)
```

### State Evolution (Pre-Dynamic)

```
σ(n) = σ(n-1) + σ_θ · (1 - 𝒜(n))      # Residue accumulation
ℒ(n) = λ · Tr(M(n)) / 𝒜(n)²           # Lock capacity  
M(n) = M(n-1) + μ · σ(n-1)            # Memory retention
```

### Viability Function

```
V(n) = ℒ(n) - σ(n)

V > 0  →  Persist
V = 0  →  Δ (Transition)
V < 0  →  Reconfigure
```

### Value Condensation

```
ρ_q = κ · [σ(n*) - ℒ(n*-1)]   at Δ where σ = ℒ
```

## Key Principles

### 1. No Borrowed Furniture

Nothing enters the system that isn't derived from the four axioms:
- No assumed state space (𝒞 is derived)
- No assumed agents (Identity is derived)
- No assumed time (emerges from σ accumulation)
- No assumed resources (ρ_q as conserved charge)

### 2. Operators Require Geometry

Book 0A is **pre-geometric**:
- No ∇Φ (gradient requires manifold)
- No ∇×F (curl requires 3D)
- No ∇²Φ (Laplacian requires metric)

These operators crystallize only in Book 0B/1 when structure emerges.

### 3. Lock Precedes Agency

ℒ (capacity to absorb σ) exists before any concept of choice or control.
Agency = Lock + Intentional ordering (Book 2+)

### 4. Value is Crystallized Misalignment

```
ρ_q = frozen(σ_excess)
```

Value doesn't come from "good work" — it emerges when accumulated misalignment hits a boundary and condenses.

## Validation Criteria

The theory is falsifiable. It predicts:

| Prediction | Test |
|------------|------|
| Higher 𝒜 → Slower σ growth | Rework rate vs alignment score |
| Δ events preceded by σ → ℒ | Metrics before restructures |
| ρ_q spikes at transitions | Value timing vs operational state |
| ℒ ∝ 1/𝒜² | Resilience vs flexibility tradeoff |
