# Book N: Master Notation & Units

## Translation Canon for Intent Tensor Theory

**Status**: ACTIVE
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## Purpose

This book provides the master translation between four mathematical layers:

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0 | GlyphMath | Meaning (ITT native, pre-coordinate) |
| 1 | Theoretical | Structure (field theory, functional analysis) |
| 2 | Classical | Relations (vector calculus, tensor calculus) |
| 3 | Standard | Calculation (scalars, derivatives, integrals) |

**Rule**: Never compute in GlyphMath. Never philosophize in Standard Math.

## Master Symbol Table

### Core Primitives

| Symbol | GlyphMath | Theoretical | Classical | Standard |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Φ | Scalar potential of distinction | Potential over collapse space | Scalar field | Φ(x) ∈ ℝ |
| ∇Φ | Ordering gradient | Ordering functional | Gradient | (∂Φ/∂xᵢ) |
| σ | Irreducible residue | Accumulated inconsistency | Path-dependent scalar | σ ≥ 0 |
| ρ_q | Boundary charge | Boundary-resolved potential | Surface charge | −ε₀∇²Φ |
| ℒ | Lock coherence | Stability functional | Constraint satisfaction | ℒ ∈ [0,1] |

### Delta Variants

| Symbol | Meaning | Layer |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Δ | Generic change | Contextual |
| Δ_id | Identity kernel (misalignment) | Δ_id = ∇Φ − C⃗ |
| δ⃗ | State vector | δ⃗ = (𝒜, σ_θ, M_ij, n) |

### Operators

| Glyph | Meaning | Classical | Standard |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| ∇ | Ordering | Gradient | ∂/∂x |
| ∇· | Boundary flux | Divergence | ∂ᵢFᵢ |
| ∇× | Feedback curl | Curl | εᵢⱼₖ∂ⱼFₖ |
| ∇² | Curvature | Laplacian | ∂ᵢ∂ᵢΦ |
| δ | Collapse event | Impulse | Dirac δ |

## Time (Derived, Not Primitive)

| Layer | Representation |
|-------|----------------|
| GlyphMath | τ (collapse index) |
| Theoretical | Recursion depth |
| Classical | Parameter |
| Standard | t ∈ ℝ⁺ |

**Key insight**: Time = ordered accumulation of σ

## Usage Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Never introduce a glyph without a layer tag
2. Never compute in GlyphMath
3. Never philosophize in Standard Math
4. Every paper includes this table as Appendix A
