## Book 4 Mandate

**What must occur when two persistent identities coexist within the same Φ-field?**

Not cooperate. Not compete. Not decide. Only **interact** in the most primitive sense.

---

## Section 4.1: Multiplicity Without Agents

**Identity Set:**
```
𝓘 = { I₁, I₂, ..., Iₘ }
```

Each I_a is defined by:
```
I_a = (ρ_q^(a), ℒ^(a), σ^(a))
```

No intent ownership. No awareness. Just boundary persistence.

---

## Section 4.2: Shared Φ Does Not Mean Shared Preference

All identities exist within the same Φ-field, but:
```
∇Φ(I₁) ≠ ∇Φ(I₂)
```

because ordering is local.

**Coexistence guarantees tension.**

---

## Section 4.3: Boundary Contact

**Definition:** Two identities interact if their collapse boundaries are mutually constraining.

```
∂I_a ∩ ∂I_b ≠ ∅
```

This is not spatial. It is **constraint overlap**.

---

## Section 4.4: Coupled σ Dynamics

When boundaries overlap:
```
dσ^(a)/dτ = f(∇Φ^(a), ℒ^(a), ρ_q^(b))
```

**Interaction = σ-coupling, not force.**

---

## Section 4.5: Interaction Classes

| Class | Condition | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Neutral | No boundary overlap | Independent evolution |
| Reinforcing | σ-coupling reduces pressure | Mutual stabilization |
| Straining | σ-coupling increases pressure | Accelerated Δ |
| Asymmetric | One stabilizes, one destabilizes | Emergent dominance |
| Locking | Boundaries fuse | Composite identity |

---

## Section 4.6: Composite Identity Formation

**Definition:** If two identities share a stable boundary and condense σ jointly, they form a composite identity.

```
ρ_q^(ab) = ρ_q^(a) + ρ_q^(b)
ℒ^(ab) ≥ ℒ^(a) + ℒ^(b)
```

This is **the root of organization**.

---

## Section 4.7: Conservation Under Interaction

σ conservation still holds globally:
```
Σ_a σ^(a) + Σ_b ρ_q^(b) = constant
```

Interactions redistribute irreversibility — they do not destroy it.

---

## Section 4.8: Emergent Influence

**Influence:** An identity has influence if its boundary charge alters the σ dynamics of others.

```
∂σ^(b)/∂ρ_q^(a) ≠ 0
```

Influence is not control. It is **constraint leverage**.

---

*"Interaction is σ-coupling. Nothing more."*
