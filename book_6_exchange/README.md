## Book 6 Mandate

**What is actually being transferred when decisions repeat under selection?**

Not goods. Not money. Not labor. Something deeper.

---

## Section 6.1: Why Resources Must Exist (Derived)

From Book 5: repeated decisions create σ redistribution.

Some quantity must be conserved across interactions, or prediction collapses.

If nothing is conserved:
- selection has no cost
- dominance has no persistence
- memory has no weight

---

## Section 6.2: Definition of Resource (ρ)

**Resource:** A conserved quantity required to resolve σ under selection.

```
ρ := transferable capacity to absorb or redirect σ
```

Key properties:
- finite locally
- conserved globally
- transferable between identities
- cannot be created by collapse alone

**Resources are σ-handling capacity.**

---

## Section 6.3: Conservation Law (First Economic Law)

**Law 6.1 — Conservation of Resource:**
```
Σ_a ρ^(a) = constant  (closed system)
```

Selection redistributes resources. It does not create them.

This law is not moral. It is structural.

---

## Section 6.4: Exchange Without Markets

**Exchange Event:** Two identities alter future σ outcomes by transferring ρ.

```
(I_a, I_b): ρ^(a) → ρ^(b) ⟹ Δσ^(a), Δσ^(b) ≠ 0
```

No agreement required. No fairness implied.

**Exchange = σ-reshaping via conserved transfer.**

---

## Section 6.5: Cost (Finally Defined)

**Cost:** The amount of ρ irreversibly committed to prevent future σ growth.

```
Cost = Δρ  such that  Δσ < 0
```

This immediately yields:
- investment
- waste
- overhead
- maintenance

All without intent.

---

## Section 6.6: Accounting Emerges

Once ρ transfers occur repeatedly, identities must retain:
- starting ρ
- incoming transfers
- outgoing transfers
- remaining capacity

**Account:** The memory structure that tracks ρ flows across decisions.

Accounting is not bookkeeping. It is **selection memory**.

---

## Section 6.7: Value Is Not ρ (Critical Distinction)

| Quantity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ρ | What you can spend |
| ρ_q | What you have stabilized |
| σ | What you must pay attention to |

**Value is frozen σ. Resources are mobile σ-handling capacity.**

---

## Section 6.8: Inequality (Inevitable)

Because selection is path-dependent:
```
ρ^(a)(t+1) ≠ ρ^(b)(t+1)
```

Even under identical Φ.

Inequality is not failure. It is **history made visible**.

---

*"Resources exist because σ must be paid for. Exchange exists because σ can be shared."*
