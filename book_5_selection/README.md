# BOOK 5: DECISIONS & SELECTION

## Constraint Resolution, Branching, and the Emergence of Agency

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Prerequisite**: Books 0A, 0B, 1, N, 2, 3, 4

---

## Book 5 Mandate

**When multiple interaction outcomes are possible, what determines which one occurs?**

Not intention. Not planning. Not intelligence. Something more primitive.

---

## Section 5.1: Multiplicity of Possible Collapses

From Book 4, interacting identities create **branching**.

**Outcome Set:**
```
Ω = { ω₁, ω₂, ..., ωₖ }
```

At this stage:
- all outcomes are structurally allowed
- none are preferred *a priori*

---

## Section 5.2: Selection Cannot Use Intent (Yet)

We explicitly forbid:
- agents choosing outcomes
- utility functions
- goal maximization

So what remains? **σ pressure.**

---

## Section 5.3: Selection Principle (Primitive)

**Axiom 5.1 — Minimal σ Accretion:**

Among available outcomes, the realized collapse is the one that minimizes additional σ accumulation subject to existing locks.

```
ω* = argmin_{ω ∈ Ω} (Δσ_ω | ℒ_current)
```

This is not optimization by choice. It is **structural inevitability**.

---

## Section 5.4: Decision Without Decider

**Decision:** The irreversible resolution of a branching under σ pressure.

```
D := (Ω → ω*)
```

Where:
- branching collapses
- unrealized outcomes are erased
- σ is redistributed
- ρ_q may increase or shift

**Decision = collapse selection.**

---

## Section 5.5: Emergence of Proto-Agency

**Proto-Agent:** A persistent identity whose internal state influences future selection outcomes.

```
∂ω*/∂δ^(a) ≠ 0
```

This means:
- its memory matters
- its lock structure biases selection
- history affects future collapses

Still: no awareness, no goals, no intention ownership.

**Agency is historical inertia.**

---

## Section 5.6: Path Dependence

From σ memory and selection:
```
ω*(t+1) ≠ ω*(t)  even under similar Φ
```

Because:
- σ is irreversible
- ℒ changes
- ρ_q accumulates asymmetrically

This produces:
- learning
- habit
- institutional inertia

All without psychology.

---

## Section 5.7: Dominance and Control (Pre-Power)

**Selection Dominance:** An identity I_a is dominant if:
```
P(ω* | I_a) >> P(ω* | ¬I_a)
```

Dominance emerges from:
- high ρ_q
- strong ℒ
- deep memory tensors

Not force. Not authority. Just **selection leverage**.

---

## Section 5.8: Failure Modes

Selection is not benevolent. Possible outcomes:
- lock-in to suboptimal structures
- σ traps
- brittle composites
- runaway dominance

These are **structural**, not moral.

---

## Book 5 Summary

Selection precedes choice.  
Decision precedes decider.  
Agency is memory under pressure.

---

*"What determines outcome when multiple paths exist? Minimal σ accretion."*
