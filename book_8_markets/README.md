## Book 8 Mandate

**What happens when many identities exchange measured resources across shared boundaries over time?**

---

## Section 8.1: What a Market Is (Strictly)

**Market:** A recurrent interaction surface where multiple identities exchange standardized units of ρ across shared σ-gradients.

A market is **not**:
❌ a place  
❌ a belief system  
❌ an equilibrium

**A market is a dynamical boundary.**

---

## Section 8.2: Supply (Derived, Not Chosen)

**Supply:** The rate at which an identity can release units of ρ without exceeding its σ tolerance.

```
S_i = max(dρ_i/dt | σ_i ≤ σ_max)
```

Key insight: supply is **σ-limited**, not preference-limited.

**You don't supply what you "have." You supply what you can release without destabilizing.**

---

## Section 8.3: Demand (Also Derived)

**Demand:** The rate at which an identity can absorb units of ρ to reduce σ or increase lock stability.

```
D_i = max(dρ_i/dt | dσ_i/dt < 0)
```

Demand exists only where incoming ρ reduces local σ or strengthens future lock.

**Demand is not desire. It is σ-hunger.**

---

## Section 8.4: Price Revisited (Now Dynamic)

In markets, prices move because σ-gradients move—not because beliefs change.

**Law 8.1 — Price Gradient Flow:**

Price moves in the direction of steepest σ-reduction potential.

---

## Section 8.5: Market Clearing (Demystified)

**Clearing:** A market clears when marginal σ reduction from exchange reaches zero across active participants.

```
dσ/dρ → 0
```

Clearing is local, temporary, unstable.

**Equilibrium is a moment, not a state.**

---

## Section 8.6: Cycles (Why Markets Oscillate)

Markets **must** cycle because:
- σ accumulates (Book 0A)
- locks fatigue (Book 4)
- resources deplete or pool (Book 6)

**Law 8.2 — σ-Driven Oscillation:**

In any non-isolated market, price and volume oscillate as σ alternately accumulates and discharges.

This produces: boom/bust, inventory cycles, hiring/firing waves, credit expansions.

No psychology required.

---

## Section 8.7: Over-Supply & Crashes

```
S_total > D_total ⟹ σ_system ↑
```

Prices fall. Identities unlock. Weaker locks fail first.

**Crashes are σ avalanches.**

---

## Section 8.8: Under-Supply & Inflation

```
D_total > S_total ⟹ σ_buyers ↑
```

Price rises. Substitution pressure. Innovation attempts.

Inflation is **not** monetary by default. It is σ congestion.

---

## Section 8.9: Liquidity (Correctly Defined)

**Liquidity:** The inverse of σ incurred per unit exchange.

```
L = 1/Δσ
```

High liquidity: low friction, fast exchange, shallow memory.
Low liquidity: slow exchange, high trust requirements, deep locks.

---

## Book 8 Summary

Supply is σ tolerance.  
Demand is σ hunger.  
Price is σ slope.  
Cycles are unavoidable.

Markets are not efficient — they are **alive**.

*"Markets are living σ-organs."*
