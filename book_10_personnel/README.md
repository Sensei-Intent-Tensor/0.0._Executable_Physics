# BOOK 10: PERSONNEL THEORY

## Humans as σ-Processors

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Prerequisite**: Books 0A, 0B, 1, N, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

---

## Book 10 Mandate

**Why humans — and why these humans — in these roles?**

No culture. No motivation theory. No personality typing. Only mechanics.

---

## Section 10.1: Why Humans Exist in the Loop

Machines:
- process Φ efficiently
- execute ∇Φ perfectly
- minimize variance

Humans:
- absorb ambiguity
- resolve contradiction
- carry σ without immediate collapse

**Humans are high-capacity σ buffers.**

---

## Section 10.2: Human Identity (Derived, Not Assumed)

From Book 4: Identity = σ-carrying persistence.

A human is:
- a deep σ well
- with slow decay
- and high contextual compression

**Humans are not decision-makers. They are entropy processors.**

---

## Section 10.3: Role–Human Matching

**Law 10.1 — σ–Φ Compatibility:**

A human can stably occupy a role only if their σ absorption profile matches the role's σ production rate.

Mismatch causes:
- burnout
- disengagement
- conflict
- turnover

**Burnout is σ overflow, not weakness.**

---

## Section 10.4: Teams as σ-Networks

Teams exist to:
- distribute σ
- close feedback loops
- stabilize memory

High-performing teams:
- balance σ load
- minimize oscillation
- share collapse costs

**Culture is shared σ-handling protocol.**

---

## Section 10.5: Management Reframed

Managers do not "motivate."

They:
- re-route σ
- terminate recursion
- maintain lock integrity

**Management is entropy engineering.**

---

## Section 10.6: Hiring as σ-Profile Matching

Hiring is not about "fit" in cultural sense.

It is:
```
Match: σ_absorption(candidate) ≈ σ_production(role)
```

Poor matches create:
- σ accumulation in the system
- compensating flows to other team members
- eventual Δ events (departures)

---

## Section 10.7: Performance (Redefined)

Performance is not output per unit time.

**Performance:** Rate of σ resolution without exceeding lock capacity.

```
Performance = dρ_q/dτ | σ < ℒ
```

---

## Book 10 Summary

Humans exist because σ is real.  
Roles exist to localize it.  
Teams exist to distribute it.

Personnel theory is **field mechanics**, not psychology.
